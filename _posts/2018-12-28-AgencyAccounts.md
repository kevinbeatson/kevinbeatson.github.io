## The Problem with Nurse Access

We use a lot of Bank and Agency Staff.
To login to Nursing Assessments, Vital Signs recording and EPMA the user has to login using a valid CPD User account (CPD is our ePR/PAS).
These accounts are Single Sign on, and so must be set up in active directory. This is problematic, since Agency nurses tend to pitch up out of hours quite a lot!

Our initial approach was to have agency staff accounts all setup and ready for this; AGENCY1, AGENCY2 etc.
The idea was that the local service would have “sealed envelopes” with user names, passwords and instructions. Once used, the details would be passed back to central user admin and the accounts re-set. There were a few problems with this;
The admin process isn’t really sustainable
Generic accounts with known passwords are not really a good thing!
The audit on any screen would show “AGENCYn” — we’d need to cross reference against a manual list of who had what & when
These agency logins can be shared i.e. more than one user using an agency login concurrently
overall — a pretty poor approach.

### What We Did
First thing was that the Nurse Bank Management and Medical Staffing got a grip as far as possible telling all Bank that they need to be on the system and trained, with access before they will get shifts. Locums need to arrange training & access  before the shift start.
Managing the process better massively reduced the problem.

### A note about the Laptops
Booting up a laptop can be time consuming and many nursing staff will want to access a laptop – often for a relatively minor system update. For this reason the laptops have a generic logon that boots into windows. The nurse then logs on to the clinical application using their normal network logon – this facilitates quick access and speedy user swapping. The laptops are tied down in general functionality.

### Technical Solution
Using our normal user account creation process we created a number of generic user accounts that matched the roles- HCA, Staff Nurse etc. These were set up on CPD just like a normal named user.
We do not create an AD/Network account to match these.
When an Agency nurse attends out of “office hours”, they report to the nurse in charge of the ward. The Nurse in charge has access to an Oracle Apex Application that we wrote in house. This application allows them to grant temporary access to the Agency Nurse;
The generic user accounts are displayed in a list;

The Nurse in charge then sets up the user by editing an available account. They select a generic user from the list, matching the level of access that is required.

They enter the Nurse details; name, role and NMC number. They must also set an end date for the access (three days max). They then allow the Agency nurse to confirm they have done the e-learning and then the password dialog appears and the new user enters their own password.
They can then use the system using the generic account name with their own chosen password.
Because we have stored the real users details that is linked to the parent generic record, we now know explicitly and unambiguously who the user was at the time of any system access.
Within any displayed audit in the system — for example showing who administered drugs, or recorded observations we normally show the username. For agency staff set up using this method, we overloaded our functions to get the details from the new structures rather than the main user table structure. This means that even though technically it is a generic agency account, the system will display the persons real name. 
At any time you can get back to the main list to remove access or re-set passwords;

It is very easy to use and the Ward staff took to it very well. Obviously the nurse in charge needs to be assured the Agency Nurse is competent.
They do have the ability to log on to a e-learning system prior to being granted access, or sit and read documentation.

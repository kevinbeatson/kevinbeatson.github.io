I'm Kevin Beatson, I have worked in the NHS since 1997. 

My plan was to stay for about two years, get **really** good at Oracle Forms development and then go contracting and earn loads of money in the finance sector. Well, that was my plan for about a week. It was never going to work.

I'm proud to work for the NHS. I'm still enthusiastic. I still think we can make a difference.
